## trsh-go

SOURCE: https://github.com/fnzv/trsh-go

Telegram Remote-Shell is a Golang script that let you comunicate with your Linux server using a Telegram Bot  <br>
This repo is a re-make of my original Python script created a few years ago [here](https://github.com/fnzv/trsh)

-----------------

 <br>

 -------------------------------
## Requirements
- Linux OS (tested on Ubuntu 20.04 and Centos 7)
- Telegram Bot created using @BotFather
- Packages required: jq
- (Optional packages used):  nmap, dig, mtr, net-tools (netstat)

## Quick setup

Before setup: <br>

* Chat with BotFather in order to create a Bot ( https://telegram.me/botfather ), just launch the command /newbot and get your Telegram Token. <br>
 Open the bot chat and send some messages to activate the bot. <br>

* Launch this oneliner+script on your Linux system (where the bot will be running as a service): <br>

```
git clone https://github.com/fnzv/trsh-go /home/trsh/ && cd /home/trsh/ && bash install.sh
```

##### WARNING: this command will install the required/missing packages ( dnsutils, nmap, mtr, net-tools )

##### NOTES:

- You will be asked to insert your Telegram Bot Token acquired on the first step and then follow the quick installation wizard. <br>

- The script will gather your chat-id based on the last unread message you send to the bot on the first step. <br>

After you finished the installation the Golang script binary will run as a system service with systemd (trsh.service).

## Usage
